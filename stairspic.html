 <p> I chose this image and didn't even realize at first that it had a 14 in it, but that was a big year for me. I started high school at that age, and really began <br>
  a long journey of self-discovery that I'm not even close to finishing. Between all of the problems I had at home and with friends, it seemed like when you see <br>
  more and more flights of stairs when you're trying to get somewhere fast. You look up and say, there's more?!. Already tired but know you have to keep going, <br>
  it seems slow and steady has never been more true than in that moment. Starting in 2016, I knew that I was already at the bottom of the emotional barrel, and the <br>
  only way out was just to keep going up. I'm recovering slowly but surely now and the flare-ups of emotions I have sometimes can feel debilitatingly hard, but I <br>
  know nothing can ever stay bad for that long.

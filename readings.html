         On Photography, by Susan Sontag.
       </li>
       <p>
      Susan Sontag's words were exceptional in explaining the way photography has been essentially exploited in different ways since its inception in the 1800's. <br>
      The uses from the perverse to family bonding were unfortunately still relatable, especially in the times we find ourselves in now. The individualism <br>
       of the United States is so isolating at times, and photography is how I attempt to preserve my memory. If I don't have someone to share an experience with, <br>
       a camera is always there to help capture an "interpreted" reminder, a word Sontag uses to describe photography. Back to individualism, it can spawn really <br>
      cool and interesting pieces of art in many forms, but the isolation for me has resulted in a feeling of not fitting in. I realized that it was put into words <br>
      when I first listened to a Blood Orange song called Jewelry in 2018. The woman in the intro says, "So, like, my favorite images are the ones where someone <br>
      who isn't supposed to be there, Who's like in a space, a space where we were not ever welcomed in or we were not invited..." While that quote delves deeper <br>
         into the rhetoric of Blood Orange, it was hard to not relate. What I want to do with the photos taken in this class is remember those feelings and work on <br>
         them, understand from where they arise, and know that it's natural to not always feel neutral towards everyting.

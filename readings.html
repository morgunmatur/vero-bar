         On Photography, by Susan Sontag.
       </li>
       <p>
      Susan Sontag's words were exceptional in explaining the way photography has been essentially exploited in different ways since its inception in the 1800's. <br>
      The uses from the perverse to family bonding were unfortunately still relatable, especially in the times we find ourselves in now. The individualism <br>
       of the United States is so isolating at times, and photography is how I attempt to preserve my memory. If I don't have someone to share an experience with, <br>
       a camera is always there to help capture an "interpreted" reminder, a word Sontag uses to describe photography.

    August 25th:
      Upon the creation of this first index, I didn't know of the wild ride I would be in for. I've known for a while that HTML was the most simple and popular to <br>
      learn first, but I didn't realize it could be so hard itself. Trying to assemble and work from the inside out in some cases while formatting a little website <br>
      is surprisingly challenging, as the barebones require more structure than I realized. It's so different than anything I've ever done. However, after trying <br>
      two different sites to get my first website up and running, I'm slowly but surely getting the hang of it.

      September 1st:
      Taking and editing the two pictures were strangely nostalgic and reminded me of small details that I hadn't thought of in a long time. First, with the <br>
      cityscape, I actually took it from the 15th floor bathroom, which made me feel a little strange but happy to have captured something so cool in an <br>
      unassuming place. For me, it was amazing to have such a view from a simple bathroom, there was nothing like that in Florida. From flat land to 15+ stories <br>
      in the air on any given day, it's a great and interesting jump in perspectives. Second, the stairs, particularly the numbers and the levels in general <br>
      caught my attention. From 13 to 14 years old it felt like being bewteeen a rock and a hard place, never really sure if I was safe or ever emotionally <br>
      healthy. However, the stairs seemed to be a reference that there's nowhere else I can go but up, and I'm so looking forward to that everyday. <br>

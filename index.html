  <p> My name is Veronica B, and I've lived in New York for two years since this past August. <br>
    Growing up in South Florida, I was exposed to many different cultures than included mostly <br>
    my own (Colombian), but also South/Central American and Caribbean. Thus, the art and influences <br>
    from those countries were all I knew for years. Broward County is not majority affluent at all, so <br>
    my peers and I grew up only hearing and imagining crowded cities with huge skyscrapers and immense <br>
    amounts of different foods you could have everyday for the rest of your life and never try twice. <br>
    Anywhere outside of the South was magical realism, an escape from what we knew. In response to our <br>
    homework prompts, I wanted to include images and words that reflect and remind me of the experience <br>
    of growing up on that weirdly isolated peninsula, and try to develop an understanding as to how it <br>
    shaped me and why I at times miss it so much.

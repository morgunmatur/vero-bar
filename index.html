  <p> My name is Veronica Barraza, and I've lived in Brooklyn for two years since this past August. <br>
    Growing up in South Florida, I was exposed to many different cultures than included mostly <br>
    my own (Colombian), and it most definitely prepared me for New York. Broward County is <br>
    not majority affluent at all, so my peers and I grew up only hearing and imagining crowded cities <br>
    with huge skyscrapers and immense amounts of different foods you could only dream of. <br>
    Anywhere outside of the South was magical realism, an escape from what we knew. In response to our <br>
    homework prompts, I plan to include images and words that reflect and remind me of the experiences I had <br>
    growing up on the peninsula, and try to develop an understanding as to how it shaped me,
    and why at times I miss my life there so much.<br>
